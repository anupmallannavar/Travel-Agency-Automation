# Travel Agency Automation (C++ Project)

This is a C++-based project that simulates a fully functional travel agency system with login/signup, state & city selection, driver assignment, billing, and rating.

## 💡 Features
- User Signup and Login System
- State and City Selection (10 states, 10 cities each)
- Route Selection with Distance Graph
- Driver Allocation (5 drivers per city)
- Fare Calculation: ₹15/km
- Rating System after trip completion

## 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms Used
- Graph (for distances between cities)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm (shortest path)
- Structures (for user, driver, location data)
- File Handling (for login/signup system)

## 📁 Files
- `main.cpp`: Main logic
- `graph.cpp`: Distance graph and algorithms
- `user.cpp`: Signup/Login and user input

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Open the project in Code::Blocks or any C++ IDE
2. Compile and run `main.cpp`
3. Follow the on-screen instructions

## 🔐 Sample Credentials
You can create a new user by signing up on first run.
